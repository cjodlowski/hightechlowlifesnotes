Quantum Synaptic Override, or “QSO” is a piece of chipware designed by [Raven Microcybernetics](Raven%20Microcybernetics.md). When paired with a program on an Agent, QSO allows for the user’s desires, motivations, and wants to be manipulated by the program.

  

QSO chipware can only be paired to one Neural Link and Agent at a time. If QSO is removed from a person’s Neural Link, all effects imposed by it subside, but will be reinstated if the chipware is inserted into the same Neural Link. If the chipware is to be inserted into a new Neural Link, it must be re-paired to an Agent.

  

QSO was internally marketed as a method of assurance and security for both corporations and fixers alike. It would ensure that employees and contractors hired would not go against direct orders, go rogue, try to manipulate a deal etc. ~~~~QSO does have limitations, it would not be able to override emotions caused by cyberpsychosis.~~ As for recipients of QSO, it was marketed as having a placating effect, allowing users to be happy and motivated to do their job, and not too worried about the ethics or consequences of their actions.


### Timeline of QSO events
- QSO is in prototyping phase by [Raven Microcybernetics](Raven%20Microcybernetics.md), who employs defensive Netrunners to maintain security 
- [_eos](_eos) discovers prototype/ blueprint files within the data center, decides to copy the files and wipe the servers of QSO information, intending to use the chip for themselves
- [_eos](_eos) is later kidnapped by [Zetatech](Zetatech.md), who forces them to give up the QSO files they kept on a memory chip inside their Neuralink
- [Zetatech](Zetatech.md) seemingly uses QSO to placate (and control) their employees - notably [Henry "Steak" Park](Henry%20"Steak"%20Park)
- [Raven Microcybernetics](Raven%20Microcybernetics.md) maybe collaborates with [BioTechnica](BioTechnica.md) to use QSO in [Project Synthetikor](Project%20Synthetikor.md)
- [Zetatech](Zetatech.md) plans to use QSO (or a derivative) in [Project Eclipse](Project%20Eclipse.md)
