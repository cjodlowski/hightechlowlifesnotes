Even after the defeat in the Fourth Corporate War, Arasaka maintained one of the largest armed forces of any other corporation. The corporation had most of its operations limited to [Japan](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Japan "Japan") and heavily reduced. Despite the situation, Arasaka still managed to hold onto a majority of their assets. By 2040, the Arasaka Corporation rebuilt itself and was slowly gaining back much of its prior strength. The corporation was also attempting to amend its relations with the NUSA and being welcomed back to continue its operations. Arasaka still had small operations in select parts of the NUSA but nothing official. Arasaka still covertly licensed their troops to other firms worldwide but they would have to use the uniforms of their new "employers." The Arasaka Corporation's goal had also not changed: they wanted to return to the political and economic height it held in the 2020s.

Arasaka may have been under the nominal control of [Saburo Arasaka](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Saburo_Arasaka "Saburo Arasaka"), but for many years there stood factions vying for dominance. As of 2045, there were three major factions struggling to come out on top. Each one hoping their family patriarch, Saburo, would eventually hand the reigns over to them.
